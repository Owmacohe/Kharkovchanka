# Kharkovchanka
*Second game prototype for my CART 315 class*

## Game features

- Infinite and procedurally generated levels
- Dynamic vehicle controls
- Snow physics

## Journal

### Design hypothesis
- Task-based research game
- Semi-historical setting
- Procedurally-generated, but with a consistent through-line story *(future development)*
- Energy / power use system *(implemented, but not used)*
- Research mechanics
  - Star tracking
  - Meteorite discovery
  - Ice core drilling

- Rogue-like in its iterative gameplay *(more future development)*

### Development

***Entry 1***

- Started with a very simple idea
- Messed around with snow physics and vehicle controls

***Entry 2***

- Added basic textures, models, and lighting
- Focusing mainly on the mechanics rather than a story just yet

***Entry 3***

- Finished snow physics
- Added terrain effects
- Made terrain modular and chunk-loading-based

***Entry 4***

- Started work on title screen
- A lot of small tweaks and optimization

***Entry 5***

- Added points of interest mechanics and models
- Created minimap

***Entry 6***

- Final cleanup
- Added info scene

## Questions for playtesters

*Make sure to open the **Start** scene first*

1. How do the vehicle controls feel? Too slide-y? Too fast/slow?
2. Would something like an energy system (would deplete with each task completed) work well here, to create consequences and/or resource management?
3. If a story were to be added, would a large, complex narrative, or a small character-based one be better?
4. In reference to the above question, I think a dating sim set between various researchers on the Kharkovchanka might be hilarious. Would this be a bad idea to pursue?
5. Should this game have music? Or is the quiet rumbling of the engine actually enjoyable on its own?

## Results from playtesting

### Main issues
- Possible lag issues and/or shader performance
- _Too much_ maneuverability
- Movement was a bit jerky
- Sound was a bit too quiet
- Lack of clear objective

### Main enjoyments
- Sound effects are good (don't necessarily need music)
- Good base for further gameplay and story development
- Movement is good, for the most part
- Snow shader is appreciated

### Improvements to be made
- Add narrative (this will help a lot)
  - Smaller rather than larger
- Radio system would be neat to implement
- Add consequences for depleting energy
- Make points of interest more interesting
